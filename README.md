Hi, 

This is my assignment for AskPhill -> https://askphill.com/

They asked me to recreate a design and make it responsive for desktop and mobile. 
I implemented this by using breakpoints in a React app. 

If I would have more time on this I would try to make it fit better on multiple phone resolutions (which right now it doesn't quite do but it works) by adding more breakpoints. 

I found that I really like to work with responsive design because it's something new to me and also has countless possibilities!
